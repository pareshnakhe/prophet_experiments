1. The effect of the external parameter is currently independent of the magnitude of y. Can we factor it in?

2. The co-efficient of the external parameter is currently assumed to be constant over the entire time period. 
   Similar to growth trend model, Iâ€™d like to define breakpoints where the coefficients can  change.

3. How to ensure that even if we large number of possible of breakpoints, only few are used. (sparse prior)

4. Generalized linear models
